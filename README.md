CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations to performe for cleanin up the data
run_analysis.R:This is the script to get output of Tidy data set as output.The script does below steps

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Tidy.txt:The code will produce the output file.
